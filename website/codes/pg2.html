  Quick hummus recipe
  This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.
  It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
  Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
  It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

<blockquote cite="https://www.webmd.com/diet/hummus-recipe-and-benefits">
  <p><em>Hummus</em> that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food.
  It deserves it.
  All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right.
  It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong>
